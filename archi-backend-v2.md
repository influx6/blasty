# v2 

## Validation

- Check that proximo works with a simple untyped cli where you pass in strings
- Use inlets to proxy locally. Is faster to test.https://github.com/alexellis/inlets
- Check you can stil gen a client. For examle in Dart. Use this as a base: https://github.com/amsokol/flutter-grpc-tutorial
 - If we cant gen clients then i have to embed the golang client insie flutter using gomobile and empire fox: https://github.com/empirefox

- Not sure what else yet.

The general demo plan assuming it works

1. a CLI
- just pass in strings to get it doing pub sub between the topcis.
 - that shows that it works
 
2. gomobile compile the thing
- i need to the client inside flutter. The reason is because this thing 

### Server
https://github.com/minio/minsql
- Has sql
- Has HA
- Muation
  - Can easily have proximo call into it and out of it. Just on the way in for a mutation, check it works and then send the CRUD event back out on the topic.
- Select
  - Send CRED event back out and let Proximo do the durable inbox to the correct clients
- Subscription on Select
  - We need to filter ( e.g Select * from Users where Firstname="ged ). SO we need to apply the predicate on the events being fired to the clients. Make sense !!!
